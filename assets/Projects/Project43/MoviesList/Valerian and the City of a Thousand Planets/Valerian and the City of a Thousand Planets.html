                    <p>In 17th century Japan, Lin Kuei assassins led by Bi-Han attack and kill members of the rival
                        Shirai Ryu ninja clan and Hanzo Hasashi’s wife and son. Hasashi himself kills the attackers
                        before falling to Bi-Han and taken to the Netherrealm. Raiden arrives and takes Hasashi’s
                        surviving infant daughter to safety.
                        In the present, the realm of Outworld has defeated Earthrealm in nine of ten deathmatch
                        tournaments called Mortal Kombat, intending to conquer Earthrealm. However, an ancient prophecy
                        is uncovered, stating that the blood of Hanzo Hasashi will unite a new generation of
                        Earthrealm’s champions to prevent Outworld’s victory. Aware of this, soul-eating sorcerer Shang
                        Tsung employs warriors to kill Earthrealm’s champions, identified by a distinctive dragon mark,
                        before the next tournament begins. Meanwhile, Cole Young, a former MMA champion, and his family
                        are attacked by Bi-Han, now known as Sub-Zero. However, Special Forces Major Jackson Jax Briggs
                        rescues the Youngs, directing them to safety and to seek out his partner, Sonya Blade, while he
                        stays behind to fight off Sub-Zero, who freezes and shatters his arms.
