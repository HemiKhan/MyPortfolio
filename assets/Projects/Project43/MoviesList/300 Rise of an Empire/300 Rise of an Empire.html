                    <p>Queen Gorgo of Sparta tells her men about the Battle of Marathon, in which King Darius of Persia
                        was killed by General Themistocles of Athens ten years earlier. Darius’s son, Xerxes, witnesses
                        his father’s death and is advised to not continue the war since only the gods can defeat the
                        Greeks. Darius’s naval commander, Artemisia, claims that Darius’ last words were, in fact, a
                        challenge and sends Xerxes on a journey through the desert. Xerxes finally reaches a cave and
                        bathes in an otherworldly liquid, emerging as the 8-foot tall God-King. He returns to Persia and
                        declares war on Greece to avenge his father.

                        As Xerxes’s forces advance towards Thermopylae, Themistocles meets with the council and
                        convinces them to provide him with a fleet to engage the Persians at the sea. Themistocles then
                        travels to Sparta to ask King Leonidas for help, but is informed by Dilios that Leonidas is
                        consulting the Oracle, and Gorgo is reluctant to side with Athens. Themistocles later reunites
                        with his old friend Scyllias, who infiltrated the Persian troops and learned Artemisia was born
                        Greek, but defected to Persia as her family was raped and murdered by Greek hoplites. She was
                        taken as a sex slave and subsequently left for dead in the streets. She was rescued and adopted
                        by a Persian emissary. Her lust for vengeance gained the attention of King Darius and he made
                        her a naval commander after she killed many of his enemies. Themistokles also learns that
                        Leonidas has marched to fight the Persians with only 300 men.
